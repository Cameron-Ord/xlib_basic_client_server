Originally I was going to use X11 hence the title and desc, but I've opted for XXB because it's modern and not 30 years old. Since wayland is starting to gain more traction, I probably dont want to use the most ancient xorg libraries. I still want this to become something though. At the moment im just reading bspwms source code to get an idea of how to do what i want to accomplish long term with this. 

I may learn some of the wayland protocol using wlroots in tandem while i work on this.
